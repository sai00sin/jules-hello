## Jules-driven workflow
- Create an Issue using the template:
  https://github.com/sai00sin/jules-hello/issues/new?template=jules-task.yml&labels=jules&title=%5BJules%5D%20New%20task
- The Issue gets label `jules`, then Jules plans â†’ opens a PR.
- To stop a run: remove the `jules` label or close the Issue.
- All PRs must be green (CI) before merge.
